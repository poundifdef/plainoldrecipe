1. If you want to add a new scraper, please feel free to make a PR. Your diff
   should have exactly two files: `parsers/__init__.py` and add a new class
   in the `parsers/` directory. [Here is an example](https://github.com/poundifdef/plainoldrecipe/commit/cac857c1abb1a8cb674a2a63ebb24df0c00aa666) of what your commit might
   look like.

2. If you want to fix a bug in an existing scraper, please feel free to do so,
   and include an example URL which you aim to fix. Your PR should modify exactly
   one file, which is the corresponding module in the `parsers/` directory.

3. If you want to make any other modification or refactor: please create an
   issue and ask prior to making your PR. Of course, you are welcome to fork,
   modify, and distribute this code with your changes in accordance with the LICENSE.

4. I don't guarantee that I will keep this repo up to date, or that I will respond
   in any sort of timely fashion! Your best bet for any change is to keep PRs small
   and focused on the minimum changeset to add your scraper :)
